Welcome to Ada's Kitchen!

Functionality:
The application allows you to view all Ada Chefs and to select their specific pages.
Here you can view all their submitted recipes.
 - You can add, delete, or edit a recipe.
 - You can create a recipe.
 - You can assign a chef to a recipe.
 - There is a view to view all recipes, and when you click on one it will show you which
chef submitted it in the title.
 - This title will change if you change the chef.

I wanted to go for a simple and clean design and function.


The application has a people and recipe controller.  There is CRUD used for the recipes
controller. That being said...

Ideas for further work to be done:
 - Use CRUD for the people controller.  I forgot to add Kelly on the Chef's list- add her!
 - Allow the user to upload a picture.
 - Make RSpec tests.
 - Use Bootstrap.
 - Re-factor the code and DRY it up.
 - Random recipe generator if one can't decide what to make.
 - Ingredient list that will generate a recipe if you have certain ingredients.
